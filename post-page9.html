        <p class="post__text">When entering into a professional relationship between a client and a developer, it is essential to establish a clear and comprehensive agreement. This agreement, often referred to as a "client contract" or "development contract," outlines the terms, responsibilities, and expectations of both parties involved. While the specific contents of the agreement may vary, there are certain key aspects that should typically be addressed:
            <br>
            <br>
            1. Scope of Work: Clearly define the project's objectives, deliverables, and any specific requirements or functionalities expected from the developer.
            <br>
            <br>
            2. Timeline: Establish a timeline for the project, including milestones, deadlines, and any agreed-upon timelines for deliverables or project iterations.
            <br>
            <br>
            3. Payment Terms: Clearly outline the payment structure, including rates, payment schedule, and any additional costs or expenses that may be incurred.
            <br>
            <br>
            4. Intellectual Property: Specify ownership and usage rights of the project's intellectual property, such as code, designs, or other assets involved.
            <br>
            <br>
            5. Confidentiality: Include clauses regarding the protection and non-disclosure of proprietary or confidential information shared during the project.
            <br>
            <br>
            6. Revisions and Changes: Define the process and limitations for revisions, modifications, and scope changes during the project.
            <br>
            <br>
            7. Termination Clause: Clarify the conditions and procedures for terminating the agreement by either party, including any notice periods or termination fees.
            <br>
            <br>
            8. Liability and Indemnification: Set expectations for legal responsibilities, limitation of liability, and indemnification for any damages or legal issues that may arise.
            <br>
            <br>
            9. Dispute Resolution: Establish a mechanism for resolving any potential disputes, such as through negotiation or arbitration, to avoid costly legal action.
            <br>
            <br>
            10. Governing Law: Specify the jurisdiction and governing law under which any legal disputes will be resolved.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is important for both parties to carefully review and understand the terms of the agreement before signing, and it may also be advisable to seek legal advice to ensure that the contract adequately protects the interests of both the client and the developer.</p>
